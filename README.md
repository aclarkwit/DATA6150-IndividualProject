# DATA6150-IndividualProject
Using biophysical models to predict the mutation of p53 tumor suppressing proteins
Utilizing both supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods to improve train classificaiton models

There are three files "code", "data" and "visualizations"

Code contains one major file "p53 Classification Models.ipynb"

This code contains all of the data cleaning, classificaiton models and dimensionality reduction algorithms

There are two data files in the "data" folder. 1) "gene5408.csv" and 2) "p53_Highly_Correlated_Features04.csv"
You will have to set the directory when running the code to reference these two .csv files
No other data files are used in the analysis

The visualizations contain figures used in the paper, with additional figures for data exploration purposes.
